			<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
				Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
				environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
			<p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
				elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
				variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
					Document Object model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place alements
					on a HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page mavigation.</li>
				<li>Server-side javaSctipt extends the core language bysupplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
					server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
					continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application. or perform file
					manipulations on a server.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>This quide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
				<li>Good wording knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
				<li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main
					page about JavaScript.</li>

			<header>JavaSctipt and Java</header>
			<p>JavaSctipt and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
				language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows
				most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow costycts which was the reason why it
				was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
				In contrast to Java's compile-time system of slasses built by declarations, JavaSctipt supports a runtime
				system based of a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript
				has a prototype-cased object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based
				model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript
				also supports runctions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
				objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
			<p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes,
				and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you
				do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly
				typed.</p>

			<header>Variables</header>
			<p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
				identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
			<p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode
				escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
				_name.</p>
